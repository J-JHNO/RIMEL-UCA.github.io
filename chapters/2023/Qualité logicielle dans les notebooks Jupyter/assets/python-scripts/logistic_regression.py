# ## MNIST Dataset Overview
# 
# This example is using MNIST handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 examples for training and 10,000 examples for testing. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image (28x28 pixels) with values from 0 to 255. 
# 
# In this example, each image will be converted to float32, normalized to [0, 1] and flattened to a 1-D array of 784 features (28*28).
